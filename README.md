The purpose of this project is so that I can build a habit of coding and working with AI to produce code. I'm new and learning everything from nothing.

This is initially just a table showing the probability of die results for commonly used dice in tabletop RPGs. On cell hover, it shows the probability of each possible result for that combination of dice.
Hopefully, this will become formatted to easily be insterted into any HTML space.

dice_prob.py was added so that I can quickly calculate and produce all of the probability tables that will show on-hover. When run, it asks for the number of dice and the sides of those dice and prints it into table rows format.
